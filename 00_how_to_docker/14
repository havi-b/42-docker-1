14. Launch a wordpress container as a background task, just for fun. The container
should be named lair, its 80 port should be bound to the 8080 port of the virtual
machine, and it should be able to use the spawning-pool container as a database
service. You can try to access lair on your machine via a web browser, with the
IP address of the virtual machine as a URL.
Congratulations, you just deployed a functional Wordpress website in two commands!

docker run --name lair -p 8080:80 -d --link spawning-pool:mysql wordpress
