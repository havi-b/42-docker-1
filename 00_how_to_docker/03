3. Define the variables needed by your virtual machine Char in the general env of your terminal, so that you can run the docker ps command without errors. You have to fix all four environment variables with one command, and you are not allowed to use your shellâ€™s builtin to set these variables by hand.

eval $(docker-machine env Char)
